# EncryptionAlgorithms

This is a little tiny simple messaging app that can work over the local network
Right now it only uses ROT# but that is ok for my purposes




## OLD AND DEPRECATED
----
This is just some simple practice to help me do some more coding stuff.

##### These are some algorithms that I plan to make (Maybe):
- Caeser cipher
    - Obvious choice. This is the basic of the basic encryption algorithms. I have to start somewhere though, and this seemed like a good place to start!
- Substitution cipher
    - Just the Caeser cipher, but a little but more random. It will be interesting to implement decryption and custom keys though I think
- I am not sure what other ones I might add...

#### Project Goals:
1. Add both encryption and decryption
2. Custom keys?!?!
3. Maybe even make an asymmetric algorithm (Eventually if I am feeling really cool...)
